In order to compile imgwmon you will need gcc and dependencies. It may be possible to compile it with another gnu99 compiler.
It has been build and tested under GNU/Linux.

1.1 DEPENDENCIES
- libyajl/1.0.12
- libcurl/7.52.1

1.2 INSTALLING
1. Run "gcc imgwmon.c -o imgwmon -Wall -ansi -pedantic -std=gnu99 -lcurl -lyajl".
If you have troubles with compilation, doublecheck the dependencies.
2. Make sure "./imgwmon" works properely.
3. Copy "imgwmon" to the appriopriate public directory.

2. RUNNING
To check the temperature read from automatic sensors simply run the binary.
All the data is available up to the last 48 hours.

2.1 USAGE
imgwmon <options>
-h  Prints usage information
-i  <id>   Set the station ID number (defaults are specified in the header of imgwmon.c file)
-d  <date> Set the date (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) (all times in UTC)
    if the type of data is set to dailyPrecip (YYYY-MM-DD)
    if empty - fetching latest possible
-t  <type> Set the type of fetching data (default is temperatureAuto)
